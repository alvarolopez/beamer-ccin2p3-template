Beamer presentation template for EGI-InSPIRE
---------------------------------------------

You will need latex-beamer class to compile it. It should be included 
in your favourite GNU/Linux distribution repositories, but it can be
downloaded from http://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home

This template can be found here:
  http://devel.ifca.es/~alvaro/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/egi-beamer/

The template was based on the EGEE one by Gabriel ZAQUINE, that can
be found in https://edms.cern.ch/document/964536/
